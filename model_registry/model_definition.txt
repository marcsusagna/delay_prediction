v0.0.1: Linear regression and logistic regression with only pax, capacity and airport as features
v0.0.2: Same as v0.0.1 but with all extracted features
v0.0.3: Same as v0.0.2 but replacing each pax_fln column by its ratio wrt total_pax, to prevent multicollineraty on total_pax effect
v0.0.4: Samve features as v0.0.3, but replacing the liner models by a random forest each
